# Points to take into consideration when writing the report
- Focus on project reproducibility
- No need for an extensive literature review
- Tables should almost never be used, box plot are generally much more applicable 
- Hypothesis should be clear prediction of outcome
- include link to github page at the end of the abstract
- include README on github page
- Aim dont get aims and objectives confused - aim must be specific
- Ensure literature review is concise and relevant to our experiment
- Ensure that we are consistant throughout the report
- aim for 20 experiment trails
- Only change the variable that we are measuring each trial
- avoid any ambiquity
